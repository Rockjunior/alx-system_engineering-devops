ALX Software Engineering Shell basics

Software engineering shell basics involve fundamental concepts related to using command-line interfaces (CLI) or shell environments for software development and engineering tasks. This includes understanding how to navigate the file system, execute commands, manipulate files, and perform various development-related tasks using the command line. Key concepts include using commands like cd to change directories, ls to list files, mkdir to create directories, cp to copy files, mv to move files, and rm to remove files. Shell scripting, using constructs like loops and conditionals, is also important for automating repetitive tasks. Furthermore, version control tools like Git are often integrated with the shell to manage source code repositories. Familiarity with these shell basics enables software engineers to efficiently manage files, perform development tasks, and interact with their development environment through the command line.
